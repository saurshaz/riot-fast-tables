# riot-fast-tables
riot fast-tables component created with Riot.


## About
This app was written to build a quick table view using Riot. 

This will enable churning out good looking tabular views 
It was heavily inspired by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) and implements the same features as those apps. 
It does not use the Riot compiler or Riot's tag-files. 
Instead it manually creates tags using Riot's API (inspired by [this blog post](http://blog.srackham.com/posts/riot-es6-webpack-apps/)).
